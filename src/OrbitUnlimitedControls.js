// OrbitUnlimitedControls, a camera controller for THREE.js that addresses some limitations of
// some other, widely used controllers:
// https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls
// https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/TrackballControls
//
// For looking around a scene, OrbitControls is a common choice.  But it has a limit on the
// rotation that can be achieved by moving the mouse vertically: the camera cannot go "over the
// north pole" or "under the south pole."
//
// TrackballControls does not have this limitation.  Yet it suffers from "twist" around the viewing
// axis, which gradually accumulates over the course of interaction and makes it difficult to
// return to an original orientation.  It also does not emit a "change" event on each camera
// movement, so updating the rendering to reflect the camera movement requires the use of
// Window.requestAnimationFrame().
//
// OrbitUnlimitedControls is free of these limitations.  It is meant to implement the API of
// OrbitControls (or at least the most important parts of that API), so it can be used as a simple
// replacement for that controller.

      // https://andreasrohner.at/posts/Web%20Development/JavaScript/Simple-orbital-camera-controls-for-THREE-js/

      // amount the mouse has moved since the initial location on the 'mousedown' event.  Note that

      // do a version of this computation, but Rohner's is easier to understand.  Note that Rohner
      // has the camera looking down the X axis initially, with Z being the initial "up".  We follow
